## Primary palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Navy | `#1e3a5f` | Headings, primary buttons |
| Blue | `#2563eb` | Links, accents |
| White | `#ffffff` | Backgrounds |
| Light Gray | `#f9fafb` | Secondary backgrounds |

## Usage guidelines

- Use **Navy** for headings and primary call-to-action buttons
- Use **Blue** for links and interactive elements
- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background colors
- When in doubt, keep it simple — less color is usually more effective

> These colors should be used consistently across all materials to maintain brand recognition.
